I'm CS graduate student at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) advised by Prof. [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). 

I'm looking for a research internship for summer 2024. If you are looking to hire an intern, please hit me up!

My research interests lie in the cross-section of machine learning and security with the general goal of aligning machine learning models towards robustness and fairness. Before graduate school, I worked in the industry for 5 years in machine learning and data science roles. I hold my bachelors in mathematics from the University of Delhi.
